		<p>Madison Stefanchik is a developing web designer with a love for the arts, music, animals and various juices. She is 
		currently studying at Pace University, and entering into her final semester in the Fall of 2011. She will be receiving a Bachelor 
		of the Arts degree in Computer Science from the Seidenberg School of CSIS, with a minor in business. Madison, 21, is currently living 
		in the Financial District in lovely New York City. On some weekends, she still ventures back upstate to spend time with her family at 
		their home in Poughkeepsie, New York.</p>
		<p><img src="../images/grace_about.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 3px 3px" />Madison’s heart is largely dedicated to her love for animals, canines specifically. She loves to enjoy the beautiful 
		Hudson River with her dog, Gracie, while upstate also. As a result of this, she has created her own small-time 
		dog care-taking services, <a href="../puppyinthecity/">Puppy in the City.</a></p>
		<p>Despite popular belief, not all techies are anti-social! Madison loves to volunteer during her free time. 
		She is associated with Pace’s <a href="http://www.pace.edu/dyson/research-and-resource-centers/academic-centers-and-institutes/ccar/">CCAR</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorkcares.org/">New York Cares</a>. She also loves to browse through new artists of any sort of genre of music, and 
		sharing her finds through various social networking sites - mainly on her <a href="http://www.madisonxleigh.tumblr.com">blog</a>. She also thoroughly enjoys while wandering around 
		the “concrete jungle” and taking pictures.</p>
		<p>Madison is currently interning with <a href="http://www.campusclipper.com">Campus Clipper</a>, but is interested in free-lance work. If you’re interested in contacting her, 
		feel free to <a href="mailto:madisonstefanchik@gmail.com">e-mail</a> her or go to her contact page for more information!</p>

The dog is a mammal in the order Carnivora. Dogs were first domesticated from wolves at least 17,000 years ago [1], but perhaps as early as 150,000 years ago based upon recent genetic fossil and DNA evidence [2][3]. In this time, the dog has developed into hundreds of breeds with a great degree of variation.

To grow well, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, moist, well-drained soil with a lot of mulch. In commercial planting, seeds are planted 45 cm (1.5') apart and 2.5 cm (1") deep. Sunflower "whole seed" (fruit) are sold as a snack food after roasting within heated ovens with or without salt added.</p>
